The Recipe Application
The purpose of my Recipe App is to help users manage and create their own recipes. Using the user-friendly interface of my app, you may input, display, scale, and reset recipes to suit your tastes. The goal of my recipe app is to enable those who, like Sanele, want to experiment with their culinary abilities and produce delicious meals.
This WPF application allows users to create, scale, reset, and filter recipes based on ingredients, food groups, and calories. Users can also save their recipes, view all saved recipes, and clear or create new recipes. The application includes some default recipes to get started.
