# Recipe-Management-System
Recipe Management System is a desktop application built using C# and WPF that allows users to create, view, search, and filter recipes based on ingredients, food groups, and calories. This app is ideal for organizing personal recipes and quickly retrieving meals that meet dietary or ingredient-specific needs.

🧠 Concepts Used
-Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Classes such as Recipes and Ingredients encapsulate data and behavior.
-WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation): UI is built using XAML with Window, ListBox, TextBox, and ComboBox components.
-LINQ (Language Integrated Query): Used for filtering and searching recipes efficiently.
-Event-driven programming: Button click events trigger search, filter, and navigation logic.
-Data Binding & UI Updates: Recipes and filters dynamically update the UI controls.
-Input Validation: Ensures only numeric values are used for calorie filtering.
